Hi, I'm Abdelkarim AIT HQI, a development student from MOROCCO. I still a student as I said earlier and I am very impressed with this area (programming) and I will work hard according to my roadmap until I became a software engineer. i take great care in the experience, learning, learning from others experiences, and code quality of the things I build.

I started learning programming with Python and I look forward with passion to learn the other languages, including C and C# despite of my great love for Python.

I learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.

ðŸ’¬ ask me about anything, i am happy to help <a href="abdelkarimaithqi@gmail.com">email</a>
